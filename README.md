A collection of essential discrete mathematics algorithm implementations in C++. This repository includes classic topics such as graph algorithms (e.g., bipartiteness checking, Euler circuits, Hamiltonian paths/cycles, graph coloring and clique problems), number-theoretic methods (e.g., Fermat’s test, Miller–Rabin primality checking, modular inverses), combinatorial computations (e.g., set partitions, solving congruencies), as well as cryptographic routines (e.g., RSA encryption/decryption).
